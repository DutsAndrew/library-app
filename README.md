How To:
1. Click the "X" circle button to remove the template book card.
2. Click the "+ Add Book" button to add a book to your library, this will open up a dropdown form
3. Fill out the input forms on the left-hand sidebar and click "Add Book", your book will now be added to the library
4. Each book will have a button at the bottom that can be toggled to change the "read" status of the book's in your library
5. If you want to remove any books or if you have made a mistake you can click the "X" button at any time to remove a book that you have created.

New Update 11/11/22:

Revisiting this project was fun. I gave a fresh update from basic HTML, CSS, and JS to React Typescript with Firebase as a backend. All "books" are saved to each user that creates an account. On the backend I have security features that only give users access to THEIR books. This being my first time experimenting with a backend, I'm excited to learn more and eventually get to NodeJS. In addition, I wrote very extensive client-side form validation with RegEx and JS form checks.

Original Design Process 05/21/22:

This project was a fun one. Getting the HTML and CSS setup so that I could see what I was working with didn't take long and is becoming more natural as I grow in my ability to code. I did hit a roadblock when transitioning into writing the JS for this project. I knew what I needed to do to get things working based on the studying that I had done building up to this project, but I was having a hard time figuring out exactly how I wanted to implement everything. I ended up just talking the assignment piece by piece and breaking it down into small chunks that I could play around with; and this is what helped me get everything working. 

At first I just wrote a simple function that would open up a form, after that I wanted to see if I could get the button that opened the form to turn red and then to close the form when clicked a second time. After I had those functions all wired up to the HTML and CSS I continued to work my way through each needed implementation as I was going through my program and noticing what I would prefer to see or how I would rather interact with the program.

Although, this project wasn't completed in record time. I'm proud of the work that I've put into this and I learned a lot about chunking the workload, taking one problem at a time, and looking at the program from a user perspective to make things easier on the user.
